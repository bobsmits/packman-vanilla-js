### Description

PackMan in vanilla javascript using canvas. To run open index.js. I implemented the original behaviour as much as possible. The game is perfectly playable but there are some things left to do to make the game complete.

## Thing I did not do
- animated sprites for the ghosts and packman
- show points and lives
- fruits
- game over screen
- multiple levels
- reverse ghost directions when switching mode
